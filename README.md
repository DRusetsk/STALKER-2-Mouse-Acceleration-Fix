# STALKER-2-Mouse-Acceleration-Fix
.ini configuration settings to turn off mouse acceleration which is enabled by default in STALKER 2. Credits to u/Silent-Skin1899 from Reddit. This made my game feel significantly more responsive and playable.
Go to "C:\Users\"user name"\AppData\Local\Stalker2\Saved\Config\WinGDK\Input.ini". For me the .ini file was blank by default. Replace the file there with this one or paste the code from the repository into the file.
